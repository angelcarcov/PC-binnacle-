I took off the m.2 out from the mobo. 
I installed again the GPU
I reconected the HDD
_Booted PC_. No problems
Resourse monitor status: Strange behaiviour at HDD; First, it stood at flat 100% disk usage for about 3 minutes running files non seen before like "Svchost.netsvc" and "Svchost. PID 2340". Secondly, when I exited chorme off from the utility box, the second 100% spike, seemed to slower from  80-90% to 7% average. 
After that, HDD stood at 5% average with some 16%-60% spikes for about 5 minutes straight. 
I downloaded Zooom directly from chrome. 
_Turned off PC._

_Booted PC_, load time as usual.
I tryied to run BO Cold War from Battlenet 
Played multiplayer, nuketown 24/7. Status: Working fine, no flickering. (textures HIGH, VRAM target: 70%)
Worked for 8 minutes, then the game crashed. 
> Notes: I didnt monitored it in the radeon software or afterburner.

I tryied running Warzone in **safe mode.**
Played plunder, BR and Resurgense without problems.

Noticed RazerSynapse was taking 4% of RAM usage
I finalized all the process related with Razer (including one with some chroma effects)
I got no display. Only the resource monitor and task manager. I exited both windows and then I got no display.
