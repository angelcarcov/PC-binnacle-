_Booted PC_. No problems
Resourse monitor status: Strange behaiviour at HDD; First, it stood at flat 100% disk usage for about 3 minutes running files non seen before like "Svchost.netsvc" and "Svchost. PID 2340". Secondly, when I exited chorme off from the utility box, the second 100% spike, seemed to slower from  80-90% to 7% average. 
After that, HDD stood at 5% average with some 16%-60% spikes for about 5 minutes straight. 
I downloaded Zooom directly from chrome.
